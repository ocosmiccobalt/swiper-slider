# Accessible Swiper Slider

A carousel (content slider) made with Swiper.

Originally, this code was based on [this Julia Dauhun's presentation](https://youtu.be/DAO9_bXCTuk) at the Accessibility Club Minsk Meetup #1.

Unfortunately, Swiper buttons and pagination bullets are divs. This prevents them from being activated via the keyboard.
